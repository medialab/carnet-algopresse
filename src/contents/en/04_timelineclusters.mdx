The analysis of the distribution of the number of articles in the six largest clusters over the 5-year period covered by the critical corpus reveals three different profiles. We find a relatively stable spread over the article distribution period in the two largest structuring clusters on the map (‘Web Algorithms’ and the ‘Future of AI’). The distribution of these two largest clusters shows that there is a regular production of critical articles on issues related to web algorithms and on fears about the future developments of artificial intelligence and robots. These subjects concentrate the largest number of articles and form two poles around which criticism is repeatedly expressed.

The second distribution profile applies to the ‘Facial Recognition’ and ‘Deepfakes’ clusters, which experienced a significant increase in the volume of articles published during 2019.

The third distribution profile shows an increase in the number of articles in 2017 and 2018, followed by a significant decline in 2019. This type of distribution applies to the ‘Job Automation’, ‘Killer Robots’, ‘Autonomous Cars’, ‘Sex Robots’, ‘Voice Assistant’, and ‘Predictive Algorithms’ clusters.

It is more difficult to interpret these irregular distributions, given the corpus annotation method used. However, they seem to show how the press, by focusing its attention on certain technologies as opposed to others, sets a media agenda through which criticism is also expressed. To verify this hypothesis that distribution is concentrated around specific periods during which the media’s attention focuses on certain technologies, independent of the production of criticism, we attempted examined the distribution of certain terms that make up these clusters within the corpus of articles labelled non-critical. These distributions show a spread similar to that found among the clusters of the critical corpus. For example, terms related to ‘Deepfakes’ and ‘Facial Recognition’ appeared increasingly frequently in non-critical articles between 2018 and 2019. All of the terms associated with sex robots, autonomous cars, and voice assistants present in the corpus labelled as non-critical occurred most frequently in 2017 and 2018, before their presence declined in 2019. This comparative analysis of the distribution of critical and non-critical articles requires further investigation, but seems to support the idea of a media agenda, independent of the production of criticism, focused on the technologies growing in visibility over a given period.
