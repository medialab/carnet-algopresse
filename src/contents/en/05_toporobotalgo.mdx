## What does the network topology teach us?

The dispersal of clusters across the topographical space reveals a contrast between two main types of calculators. We find a separation between the right-hand side of the graph, which groups together articles presenting algorithmic calculation techniques incorporated into users’ environments to guide, direct, or calculate their behaviours, and the left-hand side, which encompasses articles characterized by the personification of AI in the form of an embodied entity independent from humans.

The first region to the right exclusively concerns algorithms, whether web algorithms such as Facebook’s newsfeed, Twitter’s trending topics section, or Google’s image and website search algorithms. The majority of these algorithmic entities are the technical layers of services offered in our everyday digital environments. Others represent more emerging technologies that are the subject of more localized and regulated development and experimentation, such as policing or predictive justice algorithms, image detection in facial recognition systems, or deepfakes.

On the far left-hand side, at the opposite end of the network, the clusters are concentrated around calculator entities that are more embodied, in the form of machines or robots. The entities populating this region are personified in physical devices that are separate from the everyday digital equipment consisting of our computers and smartphones. These devices have an autonomous capacity to act via AI-based calculation systems. By simulating both the human body and humans’ cognitive abilities, they are capable of carrying out certain actions without human intervention in diverse conditions, such as transportation using autonomous vehicles, military actions using killer robots and drones, work using task automation, or even physical relations using sex robots.

Between these two poles there is an intermediate region that is more difficult to identify, composed of devices halfway between autonomous machines and the algorithms of our everyday digital environments. The calculating entities present in this space include voice assistants embedded in smartphones or smart speakers, online chatbots, robo-advisors (algorithms that carry out transactions in the finance sector), or deep learning technologies such as Google’s Deep Dream device. Despite being relatively accessible to the general public, these are often still emerging technologies. They are capable of autonomously managing a specific number of sometimes basic tasks, but are not yet embodied in physical devices; on the contrary, they are most often implemented and accessible through computers and smartphones.

Given the graph’s separation of calculation devices with different properties, we explored these dimensions in greater depth. To conduct a comparative analysis of the two poles that stand out in the topographical analysis, we decided to divide the network into two subsets that are comparable in terms of volume of articles, clusters, and terms. The space entitled ‘Robots’ contains 52% of the articles in the corpus and 9 clusters. The space entitled ‘Algorithms’ has 48% of the articles, and 14 clusters. Using a comparative approach, this division into two equivalent subsets allows us to explore the different attributes that populate these two semantic spaces.

## Method: Division of the network and the corpus based on the topology

To facilitate a comparative analysis between the semantic space interpreted as being related to ‘robots’, and that related to ‘algorithms’, each cluster was associated with one of these two categories. The two subsets are comparable in terms of volume of articles.

The ‘robots’ space contains:
- 9 clusters
- 52% of corpus articles (with each article being associated with a single cluster)

The ‘algorithms’ space contains:
- 14 clusters
- 48% of corpus articles (with each article being associated with a single cluster)
