By extracting the most frequently occurring terms from the content of the 2091 articles annotated as critical, we produced a semantic network composed of 2991 terms (or series of terms) interconnected by 54,062 co-occurrence links. The spatialization is based on a variant of the Fruchterman Reingold algorithm. The position of nodes is optimized through their belonging to clusters automatically detected by the Louvain algorithm. The colour of nodes is a function of each of the clusters thus detected, and their size is a function of their frequency in the corpus.

The most commonly occurring terms in each of the clusters can be used to interpret and name the subjects that structure the semantic space of this corpus of articles criticizing AI and algorithms. The map consists of 23 thematic clusters of varying sizes that represent types of calculators or different fields of application. Each term is associated with a single cluster, even if it can have relationships of co-occurrence with other terms belonging to different clusters. Similarly, as a function of the terms that it contains, each article in the corpus is linked to a cluster. An initial analysis of the network consists of describing the subjects most present in the corpus in terms of number of articles and of providing a brief illustration of this, using examples of prototypical titles associated with them.

The two largest clusters in the graph in terms of number of articles from two opposite poles.

The largest, called ‘Web Algorithms’ and which accounts for 22% of articles in the critical corpus, contains articles about the issues caused by web algorithms, such as Facebook’s newsfeed categorization techniques (*Facebook accused of censoring conservatives, report says - The Guardian - 10/05/16*), YouTube’s video recommendations (*YouTube, the Great Radicalizer - The New York Times - 11/03/18*), or search engines such as Google (*Google results claim that the Holocaust didn't happen, and company won't change it - Independent Online - 15/12/16*).

On the opposite side of the network is the second largest cluster, called the ‘Future of AI’ and which accounts for 18% of articles in the corpus. It discusses the risks of the emergence of artificial intelligence and autonomous machines that imitate or surpass human abilities (*AI will create 'useless class' of humans, predicts bestselling historian - The Guardian - 20/05/16*) or which threaten to cause the extinction of humanity (*End of Humanity? Artificial Intelligence could destroy us ‘within decades’ warns expert - express.co.uk - 15/04/16*).

Among the largest clusters, there are three other subjects frequently found in the corpus.

The ‘Job Automation’ cluster (14% of articles) contains articles warning of the risks of changes in the employment market faced with robotization and roll-out of AI in the employment world (*Robots and AI are threatening close to a third of UK jobs, study reveals - Independent Online - 24/03/17*).

The ‘Killer Robots’ cluster (11% of articles) is composed of articles on the risks of AI and autonomous machines in the context of armed conflict (*Top scientists call for ban on killer robots to prevent apocalyptic war - dailystar.co.uk - 20/08/17*).

The ‘Facial Recognition’ cluster, which accounts for 10% of the articles in the corpus, concerns the different developments in facial recognition technologies used in public spaces, in software, or on online platforms (*China is now using facial recognition cameras to monitor Uighur Muslims across the country, report claims - Mail Online - 15/04/19*).

Together, these five largest subject clusters prevail in the media space, making up 75.6% of all articles in the critical corpus (1,581 articles) and accounting for 46.4% of the terms in the semantic network (1,389 terms).

A second group, despite being highly heterogeneous in terms of subjects and their position in the network, is composed of 9 clusters that represent between 1% and 4% of the total number of articles in the corpus. Together, these subjects account for 21.6% of articles in the corpus (452 articles) and 38% of semantic network terms (1136 terms). This subset contains the following clusters:

The graph contains 9 additional small clusters, each of which accounts for 0.8% to 0.1% of articles (58 articles in total). Nonetheless, the terms extracted from these articles (466 in total) account for 15.6% of all terms in the graph. These subjects resemble weak signals of criticism of algorithms and AI that was detected by our term extraction method but is nonetheless under-represented in terms of number of articles. These clusters are focused on very specific subjects, sometimes mentioning types of calculators, but most often fields of application:
- **“Robot-Advisers”** : *Mortgage algorithms found to have racial bias* - The Washington Post - 15/11/18
- **“DeepDream Nightmares”** : *The AI 'nightmare machine': Spooky Google algorithm transforms famous sights into horror scenes* - Mail Online - 25/10/16

- **“Image Search”** : *Three black teenagers': anger as Google image search shows police mugshots* - The Guardian - 10/06/16
- **“Email”** : *Google expands 'creepy' Gmail AI that can automatically reply to emails for you* - Mail Online - 31/08/18
- **“Music”** : *Why 'random' shuffle feels far from random* - Independent Online - 24/02/15
- **“Consumer and Copyright”** : *Apple is forced to change its App Store search algorithm after it emerged its own products were being ranked significantly higher* - Mail Online - 09/09/19

<h2>Method: Term extraction and spatialization of the semantic network</h2>

**Extraction of terms from the corpus:**
The semantic analysis of the critical corpus was conducted using the software Cortext (https://www.cortext.net). Term extraction was carried out across the full text of articles (title, lead paragraph, and text), followed by cleaning the lists of extracted terms by deleting stopwords (video file tags or timecode elements not cleaned in Factiva). Term extraction was carried out using the “pigeonhole” measure (which gives more weight to the specificity of terms and their number of occurrences per document) at the phrase level. A total of 6,000 terms, including monograms, bigrams, and trigrams were extracted. While it may seem strange that some relatively similar terms were retained, such as all variants of facial recognition, we chose to conserve this heterogeneity in order to convey the diversity of ways of defining calculator entities in articles.

**Spatialization of the semantic network and clustering:** By extracting the most frequently occurring terms from the content of the 2,091 articles annotated as critical, we produced a semantic network composed of 2,991 terms (or series of terms) interconnected by 54,062 co-occurrence links. The spatialization is based on a variant of the Fruchterman Reingold algorithm. The position of nodes is optimized through their belonging to clusters automatically detected by the Louvain algorithm. The colour of nodes is a function of each of the clusters thus detected and their size is a function of their frequency in the corpus
