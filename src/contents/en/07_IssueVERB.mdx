## How are the issues produced by these technologies expressed?

Another way to undertake this comparative analysis of issues and the forms of agency associated with calculators is to explore another semantic entity in the corpus of articles: verbs. After extracting a list of verbs that can be interpreted as potentially linked to the issues produced by technical devices, we calculated the relative frequency of this vebrs in the two subsets of articles composing the two poles highlighted by the network topology.

The most frequent verbs in the articles composing the ‘Robots’ semantic space support the analysis of issues carried out using terms categorized as ‘Issues’ in the graph. We find a more frequent occurrence of verbs expressing a threat caused by machines and autonomous intelligence pertaining to a prophetic or even apocalyptic discourse. The verbs as being likely to express issues include verbs relating not only to destruction (*doom, destroy, eradicate, kill, eliminate*) and to the notion of machines dominating humans (*enslave, dominate*), but also to how humans are being surpassed or replaced by these technical entities (*overtake, surpass, replace, defeat*). Other verbs occurring more frequently in the ‘Robots’ subset refer to concepts of transformation and change (*reshape, transform, disrupt*) or to the abilities of these technical entities to imitate or simulate human behaviour (*resemble, simulate, reproduce*).

In the subset of articles associated with ‘Algorithms’, we also find verbs that support the previous analyses carried out based on the ‘Issues’ categories in the network of terms. The verbs in this part of the corpus refer to issues related to information filtering and censorship (*filter, delete, supress, censor*), surveillance and privacy issues (*profile, suspect, spy, target, track*), denouncing forms of discrimination (*bias, discriminate*), or phenomena concerning the propagation and spread of fraudulent content (*promote, amplify, spread*).

<h2>Method: Extraction of issue-related verbs and calculation of the relative frequency over the corpus</h2>

The analysis of issue-related verbs was carried out by first extracting 1,000 verbs from the full text of the critical articles in the corpus, using the pigeonhole method on the software Cortext (identical to the method for extracting the graph terms). The list of verbs produced was first manually annotated to extract a list of verbs that could be interpreted as problems, difficulties, or issues. A limited list of 66 verbs explicitly interpretable as being issue-related was selected.

We then measure the relative frequency of issue-related verbs in both Algorithm and Robot subcorpus, showing which entities are particularly over/under-represented on both side of our network. More precisely, for an entity i, we measure and plot the following score:
>s(i) = log (p(i|Algos)/p(i|Algos))

s(i) is positive when the relative frequency of the entity i is used more often in the Algorithms subcorpus. Conversely, negative values correspond to entities which are concentrated in the Robots subcorpus. The height of bars measure how important the deviation is.
