To highlight the features of these two critical spaces, we sought to systematically identify the naming of technical entities, the society that is home to them, and the way that the former affect the latter. All of this criticism seeks to describe the way in which Entities produce Victims by conducting a certain type of operation, with Victims constituting a set of issues pertaining to either the challenges or concerns produced by the deployment of AI techniques in our societies (Cardon, Crépel, 2019).

In order to differentiate between these entities in the network, the majority of terms (those which were not excessively ambiguous, 66% of the terms in the graph) were manually annotated into ten different categories. Our analysis consists in comparing three of these categories which seem particularly relevant for distinguishing between the two spaces. The ‘Technical’ category refers to our definition of calculator entities; it concerns not only all terms related to technical entities such as algorithms, machines, functionalities, technical services, or terminals, but also the technologies created by start-ups, which are sometimes difficult to differentiate from economic entities. The second category, which is related to human entities and is called ‘People’, concerns all terms referring to people or unnamed groups of people (as opposed to the ‘Person’ category for proper nouns and the ‘Institutions’ category for groups or structures with a legal existence). The third category, called ‘Issues’, allows us to identify the terms used to name the concerns, difficulties, or problems extracted from the articles.


## Which are the technical entities?

If we compare the most frequent terms categorized as technical entities, the defining feature of the ‘Robots’ space of our map is the very high degree of intelligence and autonomy of AI, as well as its capacity to be embodied in the form of machines. Whether for driving vehicles, sex, war, or industrial production, these technical entities have the capacity to take the initiative autonomously.

  legend={'filtrage par tag "techinal" et meta-cluster "robots"'}
/>

We see that in the ‘Robots’ space, the calculators most often refer to embodied devices such as *robots*, *machines*, *computers*, *cars*, *weapons*, *drones* ou *dolls*. Other technical entities stand out because they refer to a very abstract and generic definition of calculators, which are given the names *system*, *artificial intelligence* ou encore comme *automation* ou *model*.

On the other hand, the technical entities in the ‘Algorithms’ space of our map are defined more as parts or elements of sociotechnical systems distributed in digital environments. This space contains abstract names, but these entities do not systematically constitute autonomous objects (*algorithm*, *devices*, *program*, *bot* ou *phone*). The majority of terms stand out because they refer to much more specific technologies, most often associated with particular technological devices, such as *facial recognition*, *deepfake*, *social network*, *chatbot*, *criminal justice algortihm* and even more specifically to the functionalities of certain services embedded in our cell phones or online, at times associated with brands, such as *Siri*, *Search engine*, *Trending topics*, *Google assistant*, *Iphone*, *recommendation algorithm*, *Facebook messenger*, *Google images*, *image search*. Rather than isolating AIs, these descriptions include them in a sociotechnical environment in which calculation plays an increasingly intense role in providing assistance, finding information, or directing or preventing a behaviour.

## What are the human entities?

  title={'Réseau sémantique du contenu des articles critiques sur l’IA'} 
  legend={'filtrage par tag "people"'}
/>

The ‘People’ category, on the basis of which the terms referring to human entities, people, or groups of people were annotated, allows us to examine the composition of the social world into which AIs have been introduced. It reveals another difference between the two semantic spaces.

On the ‘Robots’ side, among the most frequent terms, those referring to humanity are strongly present, such as *humans*, *humankind*, *human civilisation*, *human driver*, *human supervisor*. The contents of certain articles associated with this space show that, in contrast with the calculator entities personified by machines, the concept of humanity is a very generic expression of human society as a whole, which is threatened by these entities. Other relatively generic terms are also present in this space but have a definition that is more focused on the sectors in which the robotic technologies will be used, such as finance, the employment market, defence, and transportation. In this group, we find terms such as *workers*, *customers*, *employees*, *drivers*, *retailers*, *soldiers*, *passengers*, *brokers*, *traders*, *farmers*.

  legend={'filtrage par tag "people" et meta-cluster "algorithmes"'}
/>

The ‘Algorithms’ space is populated with terms that are much less generic than those of the ‘Robots’ space. In it, human entities are named much more precisely and refer to better-identified people. For example, among the most frequent terms in this space, we find entities that refer to digital platforms (*users*, *accounts*, *Facebook users*, *Youtube users*). In the large majority of cases, the terms used to name these human entities allow them to be described in terms of certain properties such as age (*children, child, kids, parents*), gender (*women, men*) ethnic group (*black people, black patients, african-americans*), political views (*white supremacists, black defendants, illuminati*) or sexual orientation (*gays, lesbian, trans people*).

The topological analysis of the clusters showing an opposition between machines or autonomous intelligence and algorithmic digital environments is supported by this more specific analysis of the most frequent terms populating these two spaces. In the ‘Robots’ semantic space, we find a sort of abstraction and embodiment of technical entities, and genericity in the way of referring to human agents, who are portrayed as the victims of the potential issues denounced in the critical articles. By contrast, in the ‘Algorithms’ space the technical entities are specified more and most often relate to services or very precise technical functionalities challenged in the articles. The human entities associated with these algorithmic technical entities do not refer to generic categories such as humanity, but are described through a variety of attributes allowing them to be identified much more precisely.

## What difficulties are caused by these technical entities?

The ‘Issues’ category allows for a comparative analysis of the terms related to the issues and concerns associated with the technical entities being criticized.

On the ‘Robots’ side of the semantic space, the confrontation between humans and AI is constantly raised as a concern. We see the presence of terms such as *attack*, *safety*, *arms race*, *Cold war*, *human extinction*, *extinction*, *natural disasters*, *AI-powered horror*, *mass extinction*, *physical damage*, which most often use the register of war or planetary destruction, warning of an existential risk to the future of humanity (Singler, 2019). These threats highlight concerns related to the control of these autonomous technologies, as is evidenced by the terms *ban*, *petition*, *human oversight*, *lack of accountability*, *superintelligence control problem*, *control problem*. Other terms refer to issues that are relatively visible in this semantic space associated with machines replacing humans and surpassing them, and a loss of human control over machines, particularly with regard to 
the economy: for example *job losses*, *surge pricing*, *pay gap*.

The terms related to the issues and concerns that make up the ‘Algorithms’ subset reveal other forms of criticism that are permeated more by legal references. The frequent terms found in this part of the network include a semantic field composed of legal references such as *crime*, *law enforcement*, *Human Rights*, *lawsuit*, *Civil Liberties*, *prejudice*, *fraud*, *public interest*. The issues generated by the technical entities criticized in the articles associated with this space concern discrimination (*bias*, *biases*, *discrimination*, *antisemitic*, *race or gender*, *fair use*, *risk score*, *liberal bias*), privacy concerns (*privacy*, *surveillance*, *Big Brother*, *privacy issues*), the difficulties of filtering or exposure to content that is inappropriate (*violence*, *inappropriate content*, *nudity*, *age restriction*, *violent crime*) or fraudulent (*fake news*, *misinformaton*, *conspiracy theories*, *revenge porn*, *filter bubble*), or censorship and freedom of expression (*free expression*).

## Method: Tagging of the graph entities

Each of the 2,991 terms in the network was manually categorized by type of entity, resulting in 66% of terms in the network being categorized into 10 different categories:

-Technical (15%): calculator, machine, functionality, device, technical service, start-up technical devices difficult to separate from the economic entity
-Company (5%): companies, start-ups, the business sector
-Fiction (1%): characters, films, video games
-Person (6%): figures in politics, media, or research, or proper nouns 
-People (8%): an unnamed person or group of people
-Institution (4%): government agency, NGO, association, university, legal texts
-Locality (1%): places
-Data_inout (10%): data, traces
-Topic (10%): sector, subjects
-Issues (7%): issues and problems

An 11th category was also established containing the terms that were difficult to interpret and which could not be categorized.
-NC terms (34%): terms not categorized because they are too ambiguous or irrelevant.
