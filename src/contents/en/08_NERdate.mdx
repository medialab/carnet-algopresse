Research on forms of argumentation in the sociology of controversies invites us to look at the way that temporal scales and the regimes of stating the future associated with them are deployed (Chateauraynaud, 2013, 2019). Coherency and credibility tests in controversies require the definition of temporal scales that modify judgements. It is by mobilizing temporal markers that connect references to the past to short- or long-term projections that actors are capable of establishing affordances in the future to modulate the type of action to undertake and the urgency of acting to address the situation.

From our corpus, we extracted 1,000 named entities that are temporal markers present in the articles. Like for verbs, we calculated their relative frequency across all articles in the two subsets entitled ‘Robots’ and ‘Algorithms’. The list of extracted entities was manually filtered in order to retain only temporal markers that are interpretable outside of the context in which they are stated. The comparative analysis of temporal markers reveals two different regimes of reference to time within the two subsets of articles.

With respect to the articles associated with the ‘Robots’ subset, time markers are related to a long timespan, regardless of whether they refer to the past or the future. For example, the large majority of markers are structured around expressions on the future that use the figure of ‘the next’ combined with timespans of decades or centuries (*the next 30 years, the next 50 years, the next 100 years, the next 1,000 to 10,000 years*). On the other hand, the statements in this space most often have the particularity of not precisely defining the time scales to which they refer (*the next few decades, coming decades, the next century, this century*). Other markers that are also present in this subset refer to the past rather than the future, and are characterized by the fact that they also refer to a relatively distant past (*150 years ago, a few years ago, a decade ago*). The entities in this subset thus have the particularity of mainly expressing a distant and often relatively undefined future.

In the subset of articles associated with ‘Algorithms’, the time markers extracted mainly refer either to the present (*this week, this month, this summer*) or to a recent past often expressed as a day, week, or month (*yesterday, recent weeks, recent months, the end of last year, a year ago*), or to or a very near future in relation to the terms of the first subset (*the next day, the coming weeks, the coming months, the following two years*).

The opposition between the two semantic spaces therefore appears to outline two different regimes of utterance that coexist within the media space and which express different timeframes. The first expresses fears projected into a future inhabited by autonomous technologies. It focuses criticism on these technologies’ ability to simulate, surpass, replace, or ultimately exterminate the human species, and thus on the threat they represent, which we should control. The other regime is rooted more in social criticism regarding the present; it uses the repertoires of the law and of injustice (censorship, discrimination, surveillance) committed against specific populations, or refers to regulatory concerns with respect to the dissemination of information (exposure, amplification).

## Method: Extraction of time markers and calculation of relative frequency over the corpus

Following the same procedure as for the calculation of verbs (see the previous Method section), the ‘Data’ entities were compared. To list these time markers, 1,000 entities named ‘Date’ were first extracted using Cortext’s Spacy model. This list was then cleaned to retain the most interpretable entities allowing us to describe the temporal dimension unambiguously. We eliminated the entities that caused ambiguities and were less interpretable, such as specific or numerical dates, durations (e.g. several years, winter), frequencies (e.g. every day, weekly), or specific events (e.g. Christmas). The relative frequency was calculated for this list of 66 ‘Date’ entities, following the same procedure as for verb entities, namely the separation of the corpus of articles into two large equivalent subsets following the topology of the graph as described above.
