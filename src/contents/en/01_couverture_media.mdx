## What is the media coverage of AI?

Our research consisted in extracting a large corpus of 29,342 press articles on AI and algorithms over a period of 5 years. We did so by means of the press aggregator Factiva applied to a set of 47 general-interest press sources in the United States and United Kingdom (27 in the USA and 20 in the UK).

Today, the term artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly used to refer to calculation devices ranging from simple algorithms to more complex systems based on deep learning technologies. In order to give a broad and functional definition of AI, we will use the term to refer to a ‘calculation entity’ encompassing all techniques that employ automated calculation to produce a result from any type of data. This broad definition allows us to understand how actors themselves define these technologies and associate them with a variety of activities and sociotechnical entities (Seaver, 2017).

The distribution of the data over time reveals an increase in the volume of articles on AI – as defined by our query (see the Method section) – over the observation period. This increase reflects the increasingly important place granted to the subject of algorithms and AI in the media in recent years. To control for this increase in our corpus, we compared it to other queries made over the same period and identical sources, for which a stable distribution is expected. The volume of articles extracted in our query shows a significant increase (163%) of publications on AI and algorithms between 2015 and 2019, whereas those dedicated to art (-9%), culture (+2%), the economy (+0%), or technology (+14%) have remained relatively stable.

This evident increase in the growing visibility of the subject of AI has been reported in other research based on statistical analyses of different information sources (Perrault et al, 2019). First, in the English-language press worldwide, based on the statistical analyses produced by the GDELT project, we find an increase in the subject of AI and related terms, such as deep learning or machine learning, between 2017 and 2019. This increase in the presence of the term AI is also clearly visible in statistics on Google Search queries in the USA, which can be analysed using Google Trends over the period of 2015 to 2019. Last of all, an increase is similarly found in the frequency of the appearance of the terms AI and machine learning between 2017 and 2019 in different document corpuses, such as those from government organizations in the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as well as in calls for capital by US companies.
