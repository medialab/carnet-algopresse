By giving visibility to experts’ and researchers’ debates around ethical issues (Jobin et al, 2019; Mittelstadt, 2019), and by broadcasting the controversies that can emerge among communities of users regarding the negative effects of calculation technologies, the media contribute to shaping representations of AI and to defining the ways in which it is acceptable in our societies. Research has shown that in recent years the subject of AI has become increasingly visible in media coverage (Brennen et al, 2018), which focuses primarily on technological advancements and potential developments in the business and industry sectors. Yet, ethical issues and social concerns – such as the risk of discrimination, biases, and privacy – are also present in the media sphere, albeit underrepresented.

Our research seeks to explore critical discourses on AI in the media sphere:
- Which controversies produced by these technologies are covered by the press?
- What types of technical and human entities are involved in these controversies?
- What issues are they accused of producing in society?

Using natural language processing on a press corpus, we show that the subject of AI has been occupying an increasingly larger space in the press over the past five years. The media space is structured thematically around different calculation technologies and fields of application, and can be divided into two semantic subsets. A comparative analysis of these two semantic spaces reveals two dominant regimes of criticism involving a variety of technical and human entities, as well as different time scales and issues. The first is structured around the injustices produced by the algorithms that shape our everyday calculation environments, which are associated with criticism of the biases, discrimination, monitoring, and censorship of which specific populations are the victims. The second space is structured around fears of the autonomy of AI and robots which, as autonomous and embodied technical entities, are associated with a prophetic discourse drawing attention to our capacity to control these entities capable of simulating or surpassing our physical and cognitive abilities. The threat to our physical safety and economic model, and consequently to all of humanity, is thus highlighted.
